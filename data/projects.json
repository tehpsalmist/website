As I was working on putting the conference together, it seemed right to me that we should have a landing page to direct our potential guests. I decided to give my newly acquired skills some practice and built this site from scratch and hosted it on GitHub pages.",

I spent the next month meticulously combing through the API documentation and learning about radical concepts like loops and variables. The document itself was built using Microsoft Excel to establish the grid layout, which was then saved as HTML. I was fascinated by the whole process, but didn't realize the impact these small discoveries would have 3 years later.",

I solved this by creating a chokidar watch script that works concurrently with ng serve to rebuild css files when changes are saved. Version 1.0.3 also added full Windows support!
